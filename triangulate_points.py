"""
This script is part of a workflow to import Ground Control Points (GCPs) from a CSV file into a Metashape project. The CSV file should follow this format:

image_name, gcp_name, image_u, image_v
IMG_0001,point 1,100,200
IMG_0001,point 2,345,400
IMG_0002,point 2,786,211

Note that the image_name must match the image label in Metashape, without the file extension.

The function processes the image coordinates of markers detected on multiple images, writes these coordinates to separate CSV files for each camera, and optionally adjusts the coordinates to the OpenCV reference system. This data can then be used to triangulate the markers and obtain their 3D coordinates within the chunk space.
